# Interesting Disscussion - Apartment vs House

In this awesome discussion we will argue about our accomodation preferences.

## House is better! - Maria Jose Linares Rico

In my opinion, living on a house is better than an apartment.
Houses are usually bigger than apartments. Houses have more space. Usually houses have a big backyard and a big frontyard.

## Apartment is better! -Sumin Lee

I prefer living in an apartment than living in a house. 
It is becouse if I live in a house there are some stuff like housekeeping and gardening for maintating good condition of house. But if I live an apartment I don't need to work for my house.
