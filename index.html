        <p>In my opinion, living on a house is better than an apartment.
            Houses are usually bigger than apartments. Houses have more space. Usually houses have a big backyard and a big frontyard.</p>

    <h2>Apartment is better! - Sumin Lee</h2>
    <p>
        I prefer living in an apartment than living in a    house. 
        It is becouse if I live in a house there are some stuff like housekeeping and gardening for maintating good condition of house. But if I live an apartment I don't need to work for my house.</p>
